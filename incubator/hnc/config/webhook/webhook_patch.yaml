  # We only filter out excluded namespaces from this object validator so that

  # namespaces won't be affected. Validators on HNC CRs are not filtered because
  # they are supposed to prevent abuse of HNC CRs in excluded namespaces.
  # Namespace validator is not filtered to prevent abuse of excluded namespace.
  # Unfortunately, this means that when HNC is down, we will block updates on all
  # namespaces, even "excluded" ones, but anyone who can update namespaces like
  # `kube-system` should likely be able to delete the VWHConfiguration to make
  # the updates.
