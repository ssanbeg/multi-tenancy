# krte includes everything needed to run Docker-in-Docker, as well as cleaning
# it up cleanly. Note that Prow uses containerd so typically, no Docker daemon
# will be running on the node without using the contents of this image!
#
# This includes Go 1.15.7 and kubectl 1.17. UPGRADE TO A NEW VERSION WHEN WE
# STOP SUPPORTING K8s 1.17 as that seems like a reasonable time. At that point,
# I'd just upgrade to the latest image that works; we don't have to increment
# one by one. Honestly I doubt the exact version of the base image makes too
# much of a difference.
#
# Please update the version of Kind at the same time you update the version of
# KRTE, if applicable!
